# Conways_game_of_life


this is one of my first c++ projects, I am still trying to learn.



I made a basic copy of Conway's game of life 



It has some flaws such as the fact that it cannot update the edges (I did this project in an afternoon).


In order to add support for windows too. this version only runs on linux.


Also in order to change the size of the grid change the #defines
